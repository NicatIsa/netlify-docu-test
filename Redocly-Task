Redoc API System
We need to install this
  ttps://redocly.com/docs/
 We will use Gitlab for source control (not github directly)

 
 Target State will allow us to develop something that looks like this:
 https://redocly.github.io/redoc/

 
 We will need to install Redocly CLI
 https://redocly.com/docs/cli/

 Use the Multifile approach

 We also need to run locally, as per this post:

 Note: I do not fully understand the relationship between Redocly and Redoc. Please pass on any questions, and Iâ€™ll get answers.
